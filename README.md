# sys-monitor

A system resource/performance monitor for the terminal built in node.js

## Installation instructions

In order to get this application to work, follow the following steps;

* Install as a global NPM package.
    * `npm i -g sys-monitor`

## Roadmap

* Improve the network monitor, this is still a bit awkward...
* List all the active processes the computer is running + their resource usage.
* Improve application architecture.

If you feel like tinkering, pull requests are welcome!
